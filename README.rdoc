A simple app for tracking content changes within dom elements and web pages.

== Things that need to change:
- URLs should be crawled with typheous hydra.  Currently the app crawls one url at a time
- Tests!!!!!
- Simple crud for the dom selectors
- Bookmarklet for selecting dom elements for non-engineers
- Google apps auth for allowing employee login
